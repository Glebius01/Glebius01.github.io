## About me

I'm a a cybersecurity enthusiast aiming to transition into a Security Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1 Analyst role. I have completed HackTheBox prerequisites for the SOC Analyst role, as well as the SOC Analyst learning path. Additionally, I have listened to a series of lectures from Harvard University to reinforce my theoretical knowledge. Now, I am working on various challenges and CTF competitions to get hands-on experience and prepare for the next exams.
